# Group Transactions

Resources related to Transaction management

## Transaction [/account/{transaction_id}]

Transaction object have some limitations:
  - Operations with amount equal to zero are ignored
  - It should include at least on non-zero operation
  - Sum of all operations must be zero (excluding ignored operations)
  - Rate value may not be present only on accounts with same currency and only for one currency. So, if you have operations only on accounts with 'EUR' currency, 'rate' field can be omited. If you have several operations on 'EUR' accounts and 'USD' accounts, 'rate' field can be omited for all 'EUR' accounts or 'USD' accounts, but not for both.
  - Same applies in opposite direction - in a multicurrency transaction operations on some curency rate must not be specified or specified it as 1.
  - Rate may not be zero.
  - Rate values may differ in each operation with exclusion: if some operation have no 'rate' field set or rate set to '1', all other operations on accounts with same currency must have same rate of 1 or no rate. You can mix operations with rate equal to 1 and operations with no rate on same currency.

Multi currency support is implemented by checking, that all operations or all operations, excluding operations for some single currency, have a rate field. During transaction balance validation, amount of the
operation will be multiplied to its rate and only after that it will be summarized. It is recommended to always fill 'rate' field, setting its value to 1 where currency conversion is not required, so currency operations with rate '1' will be used as base currency. It is also recommended to use system's default currency as a conversion base.

## BudgetEntry [/budget/{budget_id}/entry/{entry_id}]

BudgetEntry lifecycle is managed automatically. It will be created with budget and deleted with budget. During creation of new non-"asset" account, corresponding budget entries should be automatically provided to all existing budgets.

+ parameters
    + budget_id: `YYYYMMDD` (number, required) - ID of owning budget in form of integer
    + entry_id (number, required) - ID of a transaction in form of integer

+ Attributes
    + account_id (number, required) - id of account, linked to that BudgetEntry. Every account could be used only once per each Budget.
    + even_distribution: `true` (boolean, required) - whether expected change on that account should be evenly distributes over Budget term or it is expected to be occasional based. For example, 'meal budget' is usually evenly distributed, you spent it in small pieces almost every day during Budget period. On the other hand, 'flat rent' is usually occasional, as you pay it only once during Budget period.
    + proration: `true` (boolean, optional) - affects the change_amount calculation. Only valid when `even_distribution` is `True`
    + expected_amount (number, required) - your expected change on account_id amount during Budget effective period.
    + actual_amount (number, required) - your *actual* change on account_id amount during Budget effective period. Calculated automatically.
    + change_amount (number, required) - hint on your spendings, helping you to keep in expected_amount. change_amount is calculated automatically as a `expected_amount/number of days in Budget term`. May be recalculated during your actual Budget execution. Only valid is BudgetEntry.even_distribution is set to `True`. If 'BudgetEntry.proration' is set to `False` it will recalculate with each submited budget related transaction as (expected_amount-actual_amount)/number of days *left* in Budget term, negative value will be cut to zero. If `BudgetEntry.proration` is set to `True` it will recalculate with each submited budget related transaction as (expected_amount/number of days in Budget term)*number of days *passed* in Budget term - actual_amount`, negative value will be cut to zero.
    + account_name (string, required) - Name of an account, linked to that BudgetEntry.
    + account_type (enum[string], required) - Name of an account, linked to that BudgetEntry.
